# healthplusplus_hackathon
Project for the 'Health++' hackathon. 
The purpose of this hackathon is to create a platform for physicians to find the CPT code for medical procedures.
To do that, we create a web page for physicians to enter the patient's treatement in a text format, and with an artificial intelligence 
(based on word2vec), we find the good CPT codes relative to the treatment.

## Before development

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
